You could set your preferences or leave them as empty to not select options except for 'True or False' options. Below are some valid examples for leaving them empty:
This is below format: QUESTION = VALID_ANSWER

## Examples of how to leave them empty. Note that True or False options cannot be left empty! 
* question_1 = ""                    # answer1, answer2, answer3, etc.
* question_2 = []                    # (multiple select)
* question_3 = []                    # (dynamic multiple select)

## Some valid examples of how to answer questions:
* question_1 = "answer1"                  # "answer1", "answer2", "answer3" or ("" to not select). Answers are case sensitive.
* question_2 = ["answer1", "answer2"]     # (multiple select) "answer1", "answer2", "answer3" or ([] to not select). Note that answers must be in [] and are case sensitive.
* question_3 = ["answer1", "Random AnswER"]     # (dynamic multiple select) "answer1", "answer2", "answer3" or ([] to not select). Note that answers must be in [] and need not match the available options.
